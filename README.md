Master-thesis project titled "Functional analysis of epigenetic differentially methylated regions in the context of rare diseases"

Objective: To compare episignature data - differentially methylated CpG sites - from two research groups.

This included annotation to genes and CGIs, analysis of enriched biological processes and distribution of CpGs in the genome.
